## Nettu Javascript Library

The Nettu Javascript library provides convenient access to the Nettu API from
applications written in the Javascript language. It includes a pre-defined set of
classes for API resources that initialize themselves dynamically from API
responses which makes it compatible with a wide range of versions of the Nettu
API.

The library also provides other features. For example:

- Easy configuration path for fast setup and use.
- Helpers for pagination.
- Built-in mechanisms for the serialization of parameters according to the
  expectations of Nettu's API.
